## Purpose of This Repository

The purpose of this repository is to help developers understand the fundamental concepts of file handling in Python. By providing clear examples and detailed explanations, this repository aims to make it easier for beginners and intermediate programmers to learn how to read from and write to files.

## Demonstration

Here is a quick demo of what you can achieve with this repository:

```python
# program.py

def read_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
        print(content)

def write_file(file_path, content):
    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
        file.write(content)

# Demonstration
if __name__ == "__main__":
    example_path = 'example.txt'

    # Writing to a file
    write_file(example_path, 'Hello, World!')

    # Reading from a file
    read_file(example_path)
```
