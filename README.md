## Demonstration

Here is a quick demo of what you can achieve with this repository:

```python
# program.py

def read_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
        print(content)

def write_file(file_path, content):
    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
        file.write(content)

# Demonstration
if __name__ == "__main__":
    example_path = 'example.txt'

    # Writing to a file
    write_file(example_path, 'Hello, World!')

    # Reading from a file
    read_file(example_path)
```
